# Openlibs
A custom built jellyfin fronted with a fresh minimal navigation UI, to host my public domain book library in isolation of other libraries. Phase of development is quite initial - the project needs a lot of work still. Idea is to implement keywords / browser cache to keep track of reading progress and pick up the page from where the reader last left reading.
